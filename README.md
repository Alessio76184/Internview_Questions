# Kotlin Coding Challenges â€“ Personal Reference

This repository is a personal collection of coding challenges I've worked through while preparing for interviews. I'm putting them aside here in case I need to revisit them for practice, reference, or sharing in the future. I hope others might find this useful.

All solutions are written in Kotlin and are entirely self-contained. For now later I might include other languages as I get more challenges.

## âœ… Challenges Included

### 1. Bracket Combinations (Catalan Numbers) - Kotlin
Calculates the number of valid bracket combinations for a given number of pairs.

### 2. Tree Validator from Parent-Child Pairs - Kotlin
Determines whether a list of (child, parent) pairs forms a valid binary tree.

kotlin
Input: ["(1,2)", "(2,4)", "(5,7)", "(7,2)", "(9,5)"]
Output: "true"

### 3. Max Profit from Stock Prices (One Transaction) - Kotlin
Returns the maximum profit from buying and selling a stock once.

kotlin

## ðŸ›  How to Use
All solutions are implemented as simple Kotlin functions.

You can copy and run any function using a standard Kotlin main() method.

File naming follows one function per file with .kt extensions.
